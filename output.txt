Experimental   
General : Melting points were uncorrected. CDCl
3 and DMSO- d6, were used as solvents for 1H and 13C 
spectra. For 1H NMR, tetramethylsilane (TMS) ( δ = 0) in CDCl 3, DMSO ( δ = 2.49) in DMSO- d6, and THF 
(δ = 1.73) in THF- d6 served as internal standards. For 13C NMR, CDCl 3 (δ = 77.00), DMSO- d6 (δ = 39.50), 
and THF- d6 (δ = 25.2) served as internal standards. Prepar ative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was 
carried out using silica gel 60 F 254, 0.5 mm coated glass plates. Gel pe rmeation chromatography (GPC) was 
performed using JALGEL-1H and 2H (Japan Analytical Industry). Boronic acid 17 was prepared according 
to a reported procedure.[1] 
 
Procedures and Spectral Data

Under Ar, isopropylmagnesium chloride (a 2.0 M solution in Et 2O, 25.7 mL, 51.4 mmol) was added to a 
solution of 4-iodophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (15.1 g, 42.8 mmol) in THF (85 mL) at −20 oC for 10 
min. The reaction mixture was warmed to −10 oC, stirred for 30 min, and then cooled to −78 oC. Triisopropyl 
borate (11.7 mL, 51.4 mmol) was added for 1 min, and th e mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for 3 h. A 
cold aqueous HCl (1 M, 100 mL) was added. After 10 min, THF was removed in vacuo. The mixture was 
extracted with Et 2O, washed with brine, dried over MgSO 4, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product 
was purified by recrystallization from CH 2Cl2/hexane (1/10, twice) to give 2 (5.61 g, 52%) as a white solid.
