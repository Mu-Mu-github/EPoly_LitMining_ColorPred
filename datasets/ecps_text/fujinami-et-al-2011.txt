ABSTRACT: Polycondensation via direct C−H arylation of
thiophene derivatives gave thiophene- and bithiophene-based
alternating copolymers in good yields. The optimization of the
reaction conditions was investigated in terms of a catalytic system
and reaction time. Under optimized conditions, the polycondensation reaction of 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene with 2,7-dibromo9,9-dioctylfluorene gave poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(3,3′,4,4′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bithiophene)] with a molecular weight
of 31 800 in 91% yield. The polycondensation reaction proceeded with 2 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 without the addition of a
phosphine ligand in a short reaction time (3 h). Six kinds of π-conjugated polymers were synthesized by the polycondensation
reaction without the use of bifunctional organometallic reagents as monomers.
ecause of their unique optical and electrical properties, πconjugated polymers are considered to be promising
materials, and they have been widely applied to optoelectronic
devices such as organic thin-film solar cells, light emitting
diodes, field effect transistors, and electrochromic devices.1−5
Conventionally, many π-conjugated polymers are synthesized
by polycondensation using transition metal catalyzed crosscoupling reactions such as the Suzuki−Miyaura coupling and
the Migita−Kosugi−Stille coupling.1−6 However, these methods require the prior preparation of bifunctional organometallic
reagents as monomers, and the polycondensation reaction
often produces a stoichiometric amount of toxic byproduct
such as organostannyl compounds.
In recent years, catalytic dehydrohalogenative cross-coupling
reactions of nonpreactivated arenes or heteroarenes with aryl
halides, so-called direct arylation, have been actively investigated.7,8 This protocol should be advantageous for the
synthesis of π-conjugated polymers with respect to decreasing
the number of reaction steps and reducing undesired waste
from the organometallic reagents. We previously reported the
polycondensation of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene with 2,7dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene based on Pd-catalyzed direct
arylation.9 We thus envisioned the extension of this method
to the synthesis of thiophene- and bithiophene-based
alternating copolymers because thiophene and bithiophene
are popular choices as monomer units for alternating πconjugated copolymers, and these units provide various
excellent semiconducting polymers for optoelectronic devices.3−5 For example, poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene),
so-called F8T2, exhibits high performance when used for
manufacturing organic field-effect transistors.10,11 This current
work is thus expected to bring significant benefits to the
synthesis of materials for optoelectronic devices. Recently,

Ozawa and co-workers successfully synthesized poly(3hexylthiophene) with high molecular weight and high
regioregularity via direct arylation of 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene.12,13 However, polycondensation of thiophene derivatives with dihalogenated aromatic monomers has not been
achieved. Herein, we report on a novel and efficient method for
synthesis of thiophene- and bithiophene-based alternating
copolymers via direct arylation.
Alternating copolymers containing bithiophene and fluorene
units were selected as the first synthetic target of this
methodology because polymers such as F8T2 are widely used
as high-performance materials. Although C−H bonds at the α
position in thiophene derivatives are most active for direct
arylation reactions, some side reactions also occur at the β
position.7,8 To simplify the assessment of the possible
usefulness of this methodology and determine optimized
conditions, 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene was used as a
monomer to avoid the side reactions at the β position in the
bithiophene unit. The polycondensation reactions of 3,3′,4,4′tetramethylbithiophene with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene
were carried out at 100 °C in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (2
mol %), a phosphine ligand (4 mol %), pivalic acid (30 mol %),
and K2CO3 (2.5 equiv) in dimethylacetamide (DMAc)
(Scheme 1). Under the experimental conditions, poly[2,7(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(3,3′,4,4′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bithiophene)] (polymer 1) was obtained without the use of
organometallic reagents as monomers.
To determine the appropriate conditions, polycondensation
reactions were carried out under various conditions. Table 1

system with phosphine ligands. Hartwig and co-workers also
reported a faster reaction of direct arylation under phosphinefree conditions than that with a phosphine ligand.22 This
phosphine-free system is valuable from the viewpoint that there
is no need to remove phosphine compounds from the
polymers. The removal of phosphine compounds was problematic because decomposed phosphine compounds are occasionally incorporated into the main chains of conjugated polymers
during polycondensation.23,24 Under the optimized conditions
(entry 6), this polycondensation reaction gave a high molecular
weight polymer within 3 h, which was superior to conventional
polycondensation via cross-coupling reactions in terms of the
reaction time. For example, syntheses of F8T2 by polycondensation via the Suzuki−Miyaura25,26 and the Migita−
Kosugi−Stille27 cross-coupling reactions required long reaction
times of more than 48 h.
The structure of polymer 1 was identified by NMR
spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Figure 1 shows the 1H

summarizes the results of the polycondensation reactions.
Because PCy3·HBF4 was reported as an effective ligand for Pdcatalyzed direct arylation of thiophene derivatives,14,15 the
catalytic system of Pd(OAc)2 with PCy3·HBF4 was examined
first. The catalytic system using PCy3·HBF4 gave polymer 1
with high molecular weight in good yield (entry 1). In contrast,
the catalytic system with PtBu3·HBF4 or PtBu2Me·HBF4 did not
promote the polycondensation reaction (entries 2 and 3),
although P t Bu 2 Me·HBF 4 was the best ligand for the
polycondensation of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene with 2,7dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene.9 Because several phosphine-free
catalytic systems promoted direct arylation reactions of
thiophene derivatives,16−18 the catalytic system without the
addition of a phosphine ligand was examined in this
polycondensation reaction. As expected, a high molecular
weight polymer was obtained in high yield under the
phosphine-free conditions (entry 4). To clarify the difference
of catalytic activity, the polycondensation reactions with short
reaction times were carried out in the presence or absence of
PCy3·HBF4. The reaction using PCy3·HBF4 gave polymer 1
with a moderate molecular weight (16 000) and yield (64%,
entry 5). Alternatively, the reaction without a phosphine ligand
yielded better polycondensation results in terms of molecular
weight (31 800) and yield (91%) of the polymer (entry 6).
Because the polycondensation reaction in the absence of pivalic
acid gave only oligomeric products (entry 7), the direct
arylation reaction under phosphine-free conditions was likely to
proceed via a metalation−deprotonation pathway.19−21 These
results demonstrated that the phosphine-free system in the
presence of pivalic acid was more active than the catalytic

NMR spectrum of polymer 1. All signals could be assigned to
the protons in the repeating unit, and no signal of the terminal
unit was observed in the spectrum. These results were
consistent with the high molecular weight of the polymer. No
signal of the branching structure was detected; this indicates
that a negligible direct arylation reaction occurred at the
aromatic C−H bonds in the fluorene units.
When 2,2′-bithiophene was used as a monomer in
polycondensation with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene, insoluble products were obtained under the same conditions as in
entry 6. The low solubility was presumably due to the crosslinked structure of the polymer. This result indicated that
reactions of direct arylation occurred not only at the α position
of bithiophene but also at the β position. To evaluate the
undesired side reaction, a model reaction of 2,2′-bithiophene
and 2 equiv of 1-bromo-4-methylbenzene was examined under
the same conditions as the polycondensation reaction (Scheme
2). In addition to 5,5′-bis(4-methylphenyl)-2,2′-bithiophene,
the formation of a trace amount of trisubstituted bithiophene as
a mixture of regioisomers was confirmed by mass spectrometry
(see the Supporting Information). Although the reaction at the
β position was minor, the minor reaction probably induced the
formation of the cross-linked structure.
3,4-Dimethylthiophene could be polymerized with 2,7dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene under the optimized conditions
(Scheme 3). In 3 h, the reaction gave poly[2,7-(9,9dioctylfluorene)-alt-2,5-(3,4-dimethylthiophene)] (polymer 2)
with the molecular weight of 10 700 in 78% yield. In view of the
molecular weight, the reactivity of 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithio68

phene was higher than that of 3,4-dimethylthiophene. The
higher reactivity of 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene is attributed
to the fact that its π-conjugated system is larger than that of 3,4dimethylthiophene.28
Various dibromo-aromatic compounds were examined as
monomers of polycondensation with 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene owing to the high reactivity (Scheme 4). The results
of the polymerizations are summarized in Table 2. The reaction
of 3,6-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole as a monomer proceeded
to give polymer 3 in 81% yield (entry 1). On the other hand,
the reaction of 2,7-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole afforded
polymer 4 in low yield (47%), even though the molecular
weight was as high as 32 900 (entry 2). The low yield was due
to the formation of insoluble products, indicating the presence
of cross-linking structures. The large polydispersity (Mw/Mn >
5) of the soluble part was consistent with the predicted crosslinking structures. Because high reactivity of the C−H bonds at
the 3 and 6 positions in carbazole derivatives for direct arylation
was reported,29 the reactions at these C−H bonds were likely
to form the cross-linking structures. The polycondensation

reaction of 2,8-dibromo-10,10-dioctyl-N-methylphenazasiline30
gave the corresponding polymer (polymer 5) in moderate yield.
Therefore, one can choose the compound as a monomer for
the polycondensation reaction. Although 1,4-dibromo-2,5dioctylbenzene possesses steric hindrance of the octyl groups
at the ortho-position of the Br groups, the polycondensation
reaction with 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene proceeded
smoothly to yield the soluble polymer without a branching or
cross-linking structure.
In summary, a novel and efficient method for the syntheses
of thiophene- and bithiophene-based alternating copolymers via
direct arylation was developed to successfully obtain six kinds of
π-conjugated polymers. In addition to the benefit of reducing
waste from organometallic reagents, the polycondensation
reaction proceeded with a reduced amount of Pd catalysts (2
mol %) in a short reaction time (3 h) compared to
conventional polycondensation based on cross-coupling
reactions. The phosphine-free catalytic system can contribute
to obtaining pure π-conjugated polymers because there are no

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

A mixture of Pd(OAc)2 (2.2 mg, 0.010 mmol), pivalic acid (0.017 mL,
0.15 mmol), K2CO3 (173 mg, 1.3 mmol), 2,7-dibromo-9,9dioctylfluorene (274 mg, 0.5 mmol), and 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene (111 mg, 0.5 mmol) was stirred in anhydrous dimethylacetamide (1.67 mL) for 3 h at 100 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. After
cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into an aqueous
solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (pH = 8).
The suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature. The
precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with 0.1 M HCl
solution, distilled water, MeOH, and hexane. The precipitate was
dissolved in CHCl3, and the solution was filtered through a plug of
Celite to remove insoluble material. A reprecipitation from CHCl3/
