nmat2272.txt,"Here, we report on the synthesis and polymerization of a series of donor?acceptor oligomers differing by the ratio of electron-rich to electron-deficient substituents incorporated, which demonstrates the rationale for ?merging? of the short- and long-wavelength optical transitions; full synthetic details are reported in the Supplementary Information. The soluble oligomeric analogues M1, M2, and M3 were synthesized by symmetrical and repeated substitution of the donor 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (DOT-(OEtHx)2) onto the acceptor core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) (ref. 32); the molecular structures of M1, M2, and M3 are shown in Fig. 1a; absorption spectra are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S1. The oligomers were then subsequently polymerized affording P1, P2, and P3, the optical properties of which were investigated as a function of the length of the donor-based conjugated chromophores (2?m) spacing BTD along the backbones; the molecular structures of P1, P2, and P3 are shown in Fig. 1a. We attribute the dark wine hue of P3 to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2), which possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6, and P7 are shown in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S2. As a method to overcome the persistent lack of coverage in the blue and green regions of the visible region, we reasoned that by copolymerizing M5 and M8 (monomer of the subsequent control polymer P8) in a random fashion but in an appropriate feed ratio, the resulting hybrid would exhibit the extensive absorption from 400 to 700?nm required for a black chromophore. This is indeed the case and an optimal ratio was found to be one equivalent of M5 to four equivalents of M8, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and corresponding to that of the repeat unit composing the well-defined analogue P7 in terms of electron-rich to -poor substituents incorporated. The molecular composition of the resulting polymer P9 was confirmed by NMR and elemental analysis; see Supplementary Information, Table S1. A number-average molecular weight of 13.6?kDa and a polydispersity of 2 were estimated by gel permeation chromatography; see Supplementary Information, Table S1. "
